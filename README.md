# <h3>Getting Started</h3>

The most simple way to get this set of examples running is to use <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html">jdk 1.8.0_231</a> which is easily downloaded from the Oracle Archive. Before 2018 (JDK 11), Oracle bundled JavaFX with the JDK, meaning you can get started straight away.
